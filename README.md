# Sisyphus Academy

## Overview

Sisyphus Academy is a multi-platform knowledge input system designed to provide ubiquitous access to personal knowledge capture through web, mobile, and browser extensions.

The current **0.1 version focuses on a Word Expansion System**, where raw user input is transformed into structured, enriched knowledge entries.

Instead of functioning as a traditional vocabulary application, the system is designed as an **automated data enrichment pipeline for words**.

---

## Core Concept (v0.1)

When a user submits a word, the system automatically:

* Stores the word
* Generates definitions
* Resolves or generates related images
* Builds structured metadata
* Persists enriched data into the database

This transforms simple user input into a structured knowledge entity.

```

---

## 1. Word Intake Layer

### Responsibility

Handles raw input from clients and ensures consistent ingestion into the system.

### Responsibilities

* Accept word input from multiple platforms
* Perform basic normalization (trim, lowercase, validation)
* Prevent duplicate entries per user scope

---

## 2. Normalization Layer

### Responsibility

Transforms raw input into a standardized internal representation.

### Responsibilities

* Normalize text format
* Prepare word key structure
* Ensure consistency for downstream processing

---

## 3. Expansion Engine (Core System)

This is the central component of the system.

### 3.1 Definition Generator

Generates semantic definitions for input words.

* Can be powered by dictionary APIs or LLM-based services
* Designed to support multiple definitions per word in future versions

Output:

```text
word → list of definitions
```

---

### 3.2 Image Resolver

Associates or generates visual representations for words.

* External image search APIs or AI-based generation (future)
* Provides contextual visual enrichment

Output:

```text
word → image_url
```

---

### 3.3 Metadata Builder

Constructs a structured knowledge entity from enriched data.

Includes:

* word
* definitions
* image reference
* timestamps
* tags (future extension)

---

## 4. Persistence Layer

### Data Model

Each word is stored as a structured entity:

```text
Word Entity:
- id
- user_id
- word
- definitions
- image_url
- tags
- created_at
```

### Characteristics

* User-isolated data model
* Schema designed for future knowledge graph expansion
* Optimized for retrieval and enrichment workflows

---

## 5. Retrieval Layer

### Responsibilities

Provides access to enriched word data.

* Word list retrieval
* Single word lookup
* Filtering support (future)
* Learning-oriented query extensions (planned)

---

## Multi-Platform Architecture

The system is designed to support multiple input sources:

* Web application
* Mobile application (planned)
* Browser extension (primary input interface)

All platforms share a unified backend processing pipeline.

---

## Current Status (v0.1)

### Completed

* Word-centric data model design
* Expansion pipeline architecture definition
* Backend system structure setup

### In Progress

* Expansion Engine implementation
* External API integration (definition/image)
* Persistence optimization

---

## Roadmap

### v0.1 — Word Expansion System (Current)

* Word ingestion
* Automated definition generation
* Image resolution
* Structured storage

---

### v0.2 — Learning Enhancement Layer

* Example sentence generation
* Multi-definition support
* Spaced repetition system
* Difficulty estimation

---

### v0.3 — Personalization Layer

* Personalized word recommendations
* Learning pattern analysis
* Adaptive review scheduling

---

### v1.0 — Knowledge System

* Expansion from words to concepts
* Connection between words and notes
* Knowledge graph structure
* Cross-domain semantic linking

---

## Design Philosophy

The system is built on the principle that:

> Input should be immediately transformed into structured and enriched knowledge.

The goal is not simple storage, but automatic transformation of raw input into usable knowledge structures.

---

## Technology Stack

* Java 21
* Spring Boot 3.4+
* Spring Security (OAuth2 + JWT)
* PostgreSQL
* Redis
* Gradle
* H2 (testing)

---

## Key Characteristics

* Multi-platform input support
* Automated data enrichment pipeline
* Extensible knowledge schema
* Separation of concerns across pipeline stages
* Designed for future AI integration

---

## Project Definition

Sisyphus Academy v0.1 is defined as:

> A system that transforms raw word input into structured, enriched knowledge entities through an automated expansion pipeline.
