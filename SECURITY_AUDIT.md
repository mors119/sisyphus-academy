# Security Audit

## Scope

This audit reviewed the repository for open-source release readiness, with focus on:

- hardcoded secrets and credentials
- deployment-specific or private URLs and identifiers
- local/generated files that should not be committed
- missing environment-variable extraction

## Summary

No committed API keys, passwords, or OAuth client secrets were found in tracked application source files.

The main release blockers were:

- deployment-specific values hardcoded in Compose files
- personal/private identifiers embedded in repo content
- incomplete `.env.example` coverage
- missing `.gitignore` coverage for generated and local-only files that are present in the workspace

## Findings

| File | Line | Detected issue | Recommended fix |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `docker-compose.yml` | 16 | Postgres healthcheck hardcoded database/user names. | Use container environment variables in the healthcheck command. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | 50-58 | Database and Redis connection settings partially hardcoded. | Source `DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, and `REDIS_SSL` from environment variables. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | 61-70 | SMTP host/port and Chrome extension origin were hardcoded. | Source `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, and `C_EX_HOST` from environment variables. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | 75 | `IMAGE_PUBLIC_BASE` was assembled from a partially hardcoded path convention. | Provide the full public image base URL through environment configuration. |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | 10-12 | Postgres database/user names were hardcoded in production Compose. | Move them to `POSTGRES_DB` and `POSTGRES_USER` environment variables. |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | 16 | Postgres healthcheck hardcoded database/user names. | Use container environment variables in the healthcheck command. |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | 36 | Backend image pointed at a personal image namespace. | Use a configurable image reference such as `BACKEND_IMAGE`. |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | 48-57 | Database/Redis configuration partially hardcoded. | Source them entirely from environment variables. |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | 59-67 | SMTP host/port and API/image host derivations were hardcoded. | Source them from explicit environment variables. |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | 76 | `IMAGE_PUBLIC_BASE` was derived from `APP_HOST`. | Use a dedicated environment variable for the public image base URL. |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | 78-82 | Kakao secret variable support was incomplete in Compose. | Add `KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET` passthrough so secrets stay in environment only. |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | 91,101-102 | Web and Nginx images pointed at a personal image namespace and fixed platform. | Use configurable `WEB_IMAGE`, `NGINX_IMAGE`, and `NGINX_PLATFORM` variables. |
| `apps/api/src/main/resources/application-prod.properties` | 46 | Mail sender name was hardcoded. | Allow override via `MAIL_FROM_NAME` environment variable. |
| `apps/api/src/main/java/com/sisyphus/backend/global/config/OpenApiConfig.java` | 21 | OpenAPI server URL was hardcoded to localhost. | Read the public API URL from application configuration. |
| `apps/web/public/locales/en/policy.md` | 10 | Personal contact email was committed in public-facing policy content. | Replace with a public support/privacy alias before release. |
| `apps/web/public/locales/ko/policy.md` | 10 | Personal contact email was committed in public-facing policy content. | Replace with a public support/privacy alias before release. |
| `.env.example` | 1-7 | Example env file did not cover the actual runtime variables used by Compose and the apps. | Expand `.env.example` to include all required API, web, and deployment variables. |
| `.gitignore` | 26-27 | `*.env.*` would also ignore `.env.example`. | Add an explicit `!.env.example` exception. |
| `.gitignore` | overall | Ignore rules did not fully cover `.gradle`, nested `.idea`, web `dist`, or local web env files. | Add explicit ignore entries for generated and local-only artifacts. |

## Local Files That Should Not Be Committed

These files or directories are present in the workspace and should stay uncommitted:

- `.env`
- `apps/web/.env.development`
- `apps/api/.gradle/`
- `apps/api/build/`
- `apps/api/.idea/`
- `apps/web/dist/`
- `**/.DS_Store`

## Changes Applied

- Parameterized remaining Compose deployment values with environment variables.
- Expanded `.env.example` to cover API, web, OAuth, mail, Redis, image, and container image settings.
- Updated OpenAPI server configuration to use the configured API host.
- Replaced the personal policy contact email with a public placeholder.
- Strengthened `.gitignore` for generated and local-only files.

## Follow-Up Before Publishing

1. Remove any generated or local-only files already present in the working tree before the first public commit.
2. Populate real secrets only in local or deployment-specific `.env` files, never in tracked files.
3. Replace placeholder contact addresses and image names with project-owned public values.
